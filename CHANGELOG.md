# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Renderer: each skinned draw now gets its own bone-matrix palette. Multi-skin
  VRMs (e.g. the Alicia Solid sample, 12 skins) rendered every mesh with the
  last-uploaded palette, so arms, hands, fingers, and legs stayed frozen in
  bind pose no matter what the animation sent. Single-skin VRoid exports were
  unaffected, which is why it went unnoticed.
- The bundled demo dance is now full-body: alternating arm swings (front and
  side), wrist flicks, head bob and tilt, hip sway, and small steps in place.
  Previously only the spine and both forearms moved.
- `VrmAvatar.relax_hands()` gently curls the fingers. `dance()` applies it
  automatically when a clip has no finger data, so hands no longer look like
  splayed bind-pose paddles during BVH dances.

## 0.1.1

- Windows first-run: `python -m kagra` loaded the VRM before `run()`, so
  `Renderer not initialized`. `kagra.run(..., on_ready=)` now fires after the
  GPU exists; the demo / README / examples load `avatar()` there.
- `kagra.load_vrma()` / `avatar.load_motion(..., "*.vrma")` / `av.dance("wave.vrma")`
  — VRM Animation (`VRMC_vrm_animation` 1.0). Humanoid retarget (including
  fingers), LookAt yaw/pitch → eye blendshapes, and preset expressions.
  Files from [text-to-vrma](https://github.com/Kirakun0328/text-to-vrma) play as-is.
  See `examples/vrm_vrma.py`.
- Publish / CI: drop macOS runners. Wheels are Linux + Windows only until a Mac
  can verify them (macos-13 also sat queued and blocked `v0.1.0` upload).
- Publish: Linux wheels now request CPython 3.10–3.12 inside manylinux_2_28
  (v0.1.0 failed with “Couldn't find any python interpreters from 'python3'”).

## 0.1.0

First public-facing cut.

- `pip install kagra` wheels via tag-triggered publish (`v*`)
- `python -m kagra` / `kagra` — sing & dance demo; downloads a sample VRM once
- `VrmAvatar.sing()` / `dance()` and a built-in song synthesizer
- `kagra.line()` no longer raises `NameError`
- Engine no longer writes `keymap.json` into the working directory
- Examples use `kagra.font()` instead of a Windows-only Meiryo path
